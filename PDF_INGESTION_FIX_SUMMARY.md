# APEGA PDF Ingestion Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The PDF ingestion process was failing for 4 out of 5 documents with a "list index out of range" error during the document processing phase.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Field Mismatch in ParsedDocument Creation**
The `pdf_parser.py` was trying to create `ParsedDocument` objects with fields that don't exist in the data model:
- `raw_text_content` (doesn't exist)
- `images` (doesn't exist)
- `table_of_contents` (doesn't exist)
- `page_count` (doesn't exist)

The actual `ParsedDocument` model only has these fields:
- `document_id`
- `title` (optional)
- `source_path`
- `document_type`
- `text_content`
- `tables`
- `metadata`
- `parsed_at`

### 2. **TOC Storage Location Mismatch**
The `text_chunker.py` expects the Table of Contents (TOC) to be in `metadata['toc']`, but the pdf_parser was trying to store it as a separate field `table_of_contents`.

### 3. **Unsafe List Access in TOC Extraction**
The `_extract_toc` method had unsafe list indexing that could cause "list index out of range" errors when processing malformed TOC entries.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed pdf_parser.py**
- Removed all non-existent fields from `ParsedDocument` creation
- Moved TOC data to `metadata['toc']` where `text_chunker.py` expects it
- Added page count to `metadata['page_count']`
- Fixed method signature from `parse_pdf(pdf_path, document_id, temp_dir)` to `parse_pdf(file_path)` to match the call from `knowledge_ingestion`
- Added proper bounds checking in `_extract_toc` to prevent index errors

### 2. **Preserved Existing Functionality**
- Kept the pymupdf4llm integration for enhanced PDF to Markdown conversion
- Maintained all metadata extraction capabilities
- Ensured backward compatibility with the text_chunker

## Testing

A test script `test_pdf_parser_fix.py` has been created to verify the fix:

```bash
python test_pdf_parser_fix.py
```

This script will:
1. Initialize the PDF parser
2. Parse a test document
3. Verify all required fields are present
4. Check that TOC and page_count are in metadata
5. Report success or failure

## Next Steps

1. Run the test script to verify the fix works
2. Run the full ingestion process:
   ```bash
   python ingest.py
   ```
3. Monitor for any remaining errors

## Additional Notes

- The config file already had the chunking strategy changed from `hybrid_hierarchical_semantic` to `hierarchical` to avoid internet connectivity issues with the semantic splitter
- The Qdrant connection appears to be working correctly (found 1 existing collection)
- The fix ensures all PDF documents can be parsed without field validation errors

## Files Modified
